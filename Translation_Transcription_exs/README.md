# Transcription and Translation Exercises

This project demonstrates basic bioinformatics workflows in Python, covering the processes of **transcription** and **translation** of a gene. It includes:

- Reading a DNA sequence from a text file.
- Computing the complementary strand (3’ → 5’) and generating the mRNA sequence.
- Performing splicing using exon coordinates to obtain the final mRNA.
- Extracting the **5′ UTR**, **coding sequence (CDS)**, and **3′ UTR** from the mRNA.
- Translating the coding sequence into the corresponding protein using **Biopython**.

The code provides a clear, step-by-step implementation suitable for **educational purposes**, illustrating the central dogma of molecular biology and how to process genomic sequences computationally.
