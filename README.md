### Age prediciton of the Abalone dataset with Random Forrest Regression 

This project focused on predicting the age of abalones using the UCI Abalone dataset, aiming to replace the labor-intensive biological ring-counting method with machine learning. Random Forest Regression and Support Vector Regression were implemented with extensive preprocessing, including outlier analysis, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction. Hyperparameter tuning through Grid Search and Keras Tuner improved performance, with the Keras-based Random Forest achieving the highest R² of 0.60. The study revealed that the dataset’s complex non-linear relationships and high prevalence of outliers limit the accuracy of standard regression models, highlighting deep learning as a promising direction for future work.

### DNA Core Promoters identification through BERT

This project investigated the use of transformer-based natural language processing methods to identify DNA core promoters, which are key regulatory regions in gene expression. Human genomic sequences were collected and tokenized using different strategies, with k-mer tokenization proving the most effective. A DNABERT classifier was designed by adapting BERT to DNA sequences, skipping the pre-training phase and focusing on fine-tuning with labeled promoter/non-promoter data. The model was trained with Pytorch using Adam optimization, dropout regularization, and multi-head self-attention across encoder layers. Results showed that 6-mer tokenization achieved the best accuracy (0.93), while 3-mer offered a more computationally efficient alternative with slightly lower accuracy (0.91). The study demonstrated that BERT can successfully capture contextual biological patterns for promoter prediction, though further work is needed to address data imbalance and optimize efficiency for large-scale genomic applications.

### Unsupervised learning techniques for differentiating healthy and diseased individuals with suspected respiratory diseases

Spirometry is a medical technique that provides a comprehensive diagnosis in the evaluation of respiratory disease. Nowadays, clinical domain experts usespirometric sequences to extract the main lung function indexes and provide a direct diagnostic to patients under suspicion of respiratory disorders. However, these parameters are not always representative of the patient real situation, as
they rely on other demographic and secondary factors. Several research studies have implemented supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, with the aim of creating models that effectively capture hidden insights from spirograms and permit to derive a clear and accurate clinical diagnosis in patients with restrictive and obstructive respiratory diseases. The current project ambitions
to provide a hybrid approach that combines deep-learning based methods and unsupervised learning techniques to produce an effective clinical outcome with respect to patient status. Continuous spirometric  data gathered by NHANES institution is utilized to perform this study. The proposed hybrid models extractrelevant patterns from volume time series through autoencoders and reservoir computing and apply clustering methods on these compressed representations to distinguish between diseased and healthy patients. Models applied to raw spirometric recordings achieve clinically significant separation between healthy and diseased groups for a subset of 20 subjects.
