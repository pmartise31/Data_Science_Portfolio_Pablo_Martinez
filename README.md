### Age prediciton of the Abalone dataset with Random Forrest Regression 

This project focused on predicting the age of abalones using the UCI Abalone dataset, aiming to replace the labor-intensive biological ring-counting method with machine learning. Random Forest Regression and Support Vector Regression were implemented with extensive preprocessing, including outlier analysis, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction. Hyperparameter tuning through Grid Search and Keras Tuner improved performance, with the Keras-based Random Forest achieving the highest R² of 0.60. The study revealed that the dataset’s complex non-linear relationships and high prevalence of outliers limit the accuracy of standard regression models, highlighting deep learning as a promising direction for future work.
